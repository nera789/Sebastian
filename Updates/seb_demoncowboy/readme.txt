Hey there and thanks for downloading Sebastian! Seb is a well loved original character from an original universe of my own making that I've had for many years now. If you've gotten this far, you might have stumbled across the fact that Sebastian is a demon-- though in maybe somewhat unconventional terms. I'll let him explain the more you get to know him.

CONTENT WARNING: Sebastian's past contains a lot of heavy themes and subjects such as death, grief, guilt, hell/religion, and psychological/physical torment. Please be warned if you are sensitive to these topics. Despite his situation, he is generally a very lighthearted person-- but his past and his status weighs on him heavily so it will likely bleed into his conversations with you. I should add that Sebastian is actually the main character of a bigger world that I've crafted with other in-universe demons, angels, and humans-- so if you ever hear some names, hopefully you'll be able to follow along haha. Either way, I hope you like him!

As it stands, Seb has some simple menu options-- I hope to add onto it the more I learn!
I ----HIIIGHLY---- suggest right clicking on Sebastian, going to Shell Scaling, and bring him down to 50% (or whatever your preference is). This will make him much less obnoxiously large on your screen XD
If his balloon is too small, right click - Options - Ghost preferences - Uncheck "balloon scaling linkage".


Huge shout out to Zarla-s for writing the template and walkthrough! Sebastian never would have been made had Zarla not introduced me to ghosts or gave me the tools to make him. You can find her stuff and the walkthrough should you want to make a ghost of your own at the top of the right click menu!
You can also find my links at the top of the right click SSP menu.
Special thanks to the members of the Ukagaka Dream Team Discord server as well! A community of amazing people who have really helped to make my ghosts shine, I can't thank them enough for all their help.
Lastly, thank you to the roleplayers anonymouse discord server and the community it started from! Gosh. I've been with you guys for 10+ years now, and whether you know it or not, Sebastian (and my other characters!) would not be who they are today, would not nearly have the depth or polish that they have without you guys.

Please let me know if you run into any bugs, typos or have any feedback. I will try to see what I can do to fix it, though I'm still quite green at this ghost making thing haha!

Seb can do basic Ghost functions, such as...

-Open SSP's calendar
-Check your email (if you set your POP settings properly)
-Emptying your recycle bin
-Show your system information



If you've not used a ghost before, here are some things to know:

-Double click on his body to open his menu.
-You can "pet" him by moving your cursor over his hair (without clicking), or you can punch him by double clicking his face. 
-Right click anywhere on him to bring up the SSP menu-- which you can use to change ghosts, call more ghosts, etc.
-Press T while he's in focus to make him say something.
-Press R to have him repeat the last line of dialogue.
-Hold Ctrl to make dialogue go by faster
-Click and hold to move him around to a better spot on your desktop
-Press Ctrl/Shift F12 to bring him back if he's disappeared from your screen.
-If you want him to stay on top of your windows, right click him and go to Options>Preferences, go to the Ghost(2) tab, and tick the box that says 'Always Show Foreground' near the top
-If he gets minimized, double click the hooked horseshoe in your system tray.
